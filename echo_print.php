echo and print are more or less the same.
they are both use to output
data to the screen

ðŸ‘‹ small difference is echo has no return value
while print has a return value of 1
so it can be used in expressions
echo can take multiple parameters 
while print can take one argument 
echo is marginally faster than print

*/


/*

The echo statement can be used with or without parentheses: echo or echo()

The print statement can be used with or without parentheses print or print()
